## How to use this README on *your* GitHub profile

1. If you want this to appear on your profile page, add this `README.md` to a repository named exactly like your GitHub username (e.g. `yourusername/yourusername`). GitHub will render that README on your profile.
2. Alternatively, paste this `README.md` into any repo you control and **pin that repo** on your profile.
3. The star badge pulls live data from the original repo — so it shows the project’s real star count and sends visitors to the original project.

## Small friendly note

This file is purely a showcase and a redirect pointer — it does **not** copy stars from the original repo. The badge displays the original repo’s star count and clicking any link goes straight to `https://github.com/IntelligenceX/SDK`.
